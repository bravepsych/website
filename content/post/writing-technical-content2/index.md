On 28th May, we ran a public workshop on Building Self-awareness (introduction to ACT) for 18 pax at Pasir Panjang Knots caf√©. 
During the workshop, we introduced the participants to the idea of multiple selves through the Self Concept theory and introduced them to the idea and foundation of ACT. We completed a self-reflection activity on Values in Life and did a small group sharing on the 3-5 chosen values. After the activity they got to keep their Values pdf (by Russ Harris) and a bookmark made by them. 
Participants were people interested in psychology, therapy and ex and current counselling clients.
