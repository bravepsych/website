On June 2023, we conducted a terrarium building workshop for the students @ Eduz Admiralty Tuition Centre

During the 2-hour workshop, we taught children (P2 and P6s mostly) how to build their own terrarium and reflect about building good habits to keep the terrarium alive, and to think about other good habits they can form in their lives (e.g. discipline).

As adults, we often think about goals as "big" actions, such as securing another work contract or making a plan to exercise every day for 365 days. It was nice and refreshing to see children writing about wanting to pack their own bags for school as a discipline goal. We all start small, dont we?
