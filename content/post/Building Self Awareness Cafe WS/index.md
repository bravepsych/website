On 28th May, we ran our first public workshop on Building Self-awareness (introduction to ACT) for 18 pax at Pasir Panjang Knots caf√©! 

During the 1.5 hour workshop, we introduced the participants to the idea of multiple selves through the Self Concept theory and foundation of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). We completed a self-reflection activity on Values in Life and did a small group sharing on the 3-5 chosen values. After the activity they got to keep their Values pdf (by Russ Harris) and a bookmark made by them.

My personal values were: 
Creativity - to think of how psychological concepts can affect our everyday lives in different ways 
Novelty- to partake in new events/activities 
Patience - to respond instead of reacting emotionally to emotionally-charged situations 

Therapist's note: 
When completing the reflection activity, some may find it easier to think of **goals** than **values**. For example, "I would like to organize a psychology workshop every 2-3 months" - this is a well-articulated goal, but it does not contain any values, yet. The underlying value could be Novelty, as the goal allows one to work on new content regularly. 

The list of values was mostly self-explanatory and it is also suitable for teenagers to complete.
