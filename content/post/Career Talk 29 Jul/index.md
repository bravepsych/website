On July 2023, I spoke at the Career Talk for incoming freshmen at the National University of Singapore, Psychology. </br>

Together with 3 other speakers, we did Q&A sharing with groups of students. I spoke about how I got started on my counseling studies and the challenges of maintaining my private practice (Brave Psychology). 

Some curious questions I received:
**1. How do you connect with clients who are not forth-coming?** 
*Fortunately (or unfortunately), I see clients on a voluntary basis (i.e. not mandated counseling). For these clients, they are motivated enough to want to make a change in their lives, and I don't encounter much difficulties in getting rapport or striking up a conversation. I believe that therapists who take on mandated counseling clients in the prison/divorce centre/similar settings face challenges in gaining rapport with non-voluntary clients, and that client drop-out is a common occurenace that we have to be okay with.*

**2. How/when did you decide to work in Counseling Psychology?**
*I had always known that I liked reading about human behaviour and applied psychology, but the educational barriers to entry to becoming a therapist in Singapore meant that I needed post-graduate studies in the field to be able to practice, after obtaining 100 hours active therapy work. Before I embarked on this journey, I was a teaching assistant in the National University of Singapore for 3 years and I felt that my past teaching experience has helped me in speaking to groups and connecting with students/youths.*
