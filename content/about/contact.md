What is talk therapy / counselling? 

Therapy provides a safe and confidental space for you to discuss the things that matter to you in your life. During therapy, you may learn communication skills to improve relationships, develop self-awareness to accept the things you cannot change, or gain insights to your life in other areas. 

How do you ensure that things shared in therapy remains confidential? 

Counselling, as a profession, follows the Singapore Association of Counselling's code of conduct. It is important for practioners to maintain confidentiality so that clients can freely share during the session and make the most out of their sessions. We maintain confidentiality by ensuring that no one besides our clinical supervisor knows the content of the discussion, and no identifiable personal information is shared with anyone, even the referring therapist.
